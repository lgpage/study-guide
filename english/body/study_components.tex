    \subsection{Lecture Plan}
        This outlines the lecture plan for the semester. Students should use
        this plan to make sure that they do not fall behind the class
        lectures and/or tutorials. There are a total of 48 lectures and 12
        tutorial sessions over the 14 weeks of the semester.

        Table \ref{tab:lec_plan} lists the number of lectures\footnote{Number
        of lectures each week per group -- English (E1) / English (E2) /
        Afrikaans (A)} per week and which study themes will be covered in which
        weeks of the semester. Each week has a corresponding tutorial which
        should be completed during the specific week in the tutorial sessions.

        Notional hours include contact time as well as the estimated time
        necessary for preparation for tests, and exams. Contact sessions
        indicate the regular lectures. The number of contact sessions per
        chapter is tentative and may change depending on the progress during
        lectures.

        Please note that some subsections in a chapter of the textbook will not
        be covered during the lectures, whereas other subsections may be given
        as self-study. The lecturer will provide information about the
        sub-sections that will not be covered for test- and exam purposes.

        Selected exercise problems, from the study notes, will be covered
        during the tutorial sessions. The selected chapters and problems (from
        the study notes) that will be covered in each tutorial session will be
        added to {\it ClickUP}.

    \subsection{Fundamental Concepts}

    \subsection{Study Theme Descriptions}
        \subsubsection{Theme 1: Introduction}
            The introduction allows the student to obtain a general overview on
            the roles and responsibilities of both the student and the lecturer
            as well as an overview on what computer programming is. This
            section will not be explicitly tested. It is important to note that
            an understanding of computer architecture and flow diagrams will
            make the following sections more accessible.

        \subsubsection{Theme 2: Basic Programming}
            \paragraph{Using Python as a Calculator:}
                The student has to ensure that he/she is comfortable with the
                \emph{Jupyter} environment and must be able to use Python to do
                simple mathematical calculations. It is the student's
                responsibility to spend enough time using these environments
                throughout the semester. The student must be able to use
                Python's built-in functions.

            \paragraph{Names, Objects and Assignment:}
                The student has to be familiar with the guidelines in the class
                notes on names and objects e.g. objects are created in memory
                and a name is assigned to that object. The student must also be
                familiar with the memory model of Python. The student must also
                know the difference between the object types e.g. int, float,
                str, bool as well as to know how to check the type of an object
                using \texttt{type()}.

        \subsubsection{Theme 3: Functions}
            The student must be familiar with functions and code structure.
            The student must be able to properly create and use functions with
            multiple inputs and outputs.  The student must be able to rewrite
            an existing computer program such that it makes use of functions.
            The student has to be familiar with local namespace and understand
            ``name scope'' within a function.  The student must understand any
            object can be be passed into a function or returned from a
            function. This includes another function and is particularly
            important for some of the built-in functions.

        \subsubsection{Theme 4: Control Statements}
            \paragraph{For Loop:}
                The student must understand that the \textit{for loop} iterates
                through iterators (e.g. the elements of a list). The student
                has to be able to identify when and why to use \textit{for
                loop(s)} from a given problem statement. The student has to be
                familiar with Python's syntax and indentation and be
                comfortable to implement \textit{for loop(s)} in a program to
                perform a given task.

            \paragraph{While Loop:}
                The student must understand conditional statements and how to
                combine them using \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} operators. The
                while continues to iterate as long as the condition evaluated
                is \texttt{true} or \texttt{1}. The student must understand
                that should the condition not update during a \textit{while
                loop} iteration, the program is stuck in an infinite loop. The
                student has to be able to identify when and why to use while
                loop(s) from a given problem statement. The student has to be
                familiar with Python's syntax and indentation and be able to
                implement while loop(s) in a program to perform a given task.
                The student also has to be able to determine the correct
                \textit{while loop} termination conditions in order to perform
                a given task.

            \paragraph{Basic List Generation:}
                The student must be able to generate simple list objects, both
                manually and by using the range function. The student also has
                to be familiar with the various list operators \texttt{(+, *)},
                functions (\texttt{sorted}) and in-place functions (methods)
                (\texttt{append, insert, index, sort, reverse}). The student
                must be able to use, read and understand Python's built-in help
                to obtain information on the various functions and in-place
                functions.

            \paragraph{Branching:}
                The student must understand conditional statements and how to
                combine them using \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} operators. The
                student has to be able to identify the usage of branches (when
                and why to use an if, elif or else statement) from a problem
                statement. The student has to be familiar with Python's syntax
                and indentation and be able to implement branches in a program
                to perform a given task. The student needs to understand how
                each of the if, elif and else statements affects the program
                flow and control. The student also has to be able to determine
                the correct conditions in order to perform a given task.

        \subsubsection{Theme 5: Solving Problems}
            The student must be able to evaluate and break down a complex
            problem into logical control statements (for, while, if). The
            student must be able to identify which nested statements are needed
            from the problem statement and breakdown and then be able to
            implement the nested statements in a program to solve the given
            problem. The student has to be familiar with Python's syntax and
            indentation for nested statements.

            The student must also be familiar with nested lists (list of lists)
            and the memory model thereof. The student must be able to identify
            when nested lists are needed from the problem statement and
            breakdown and be able to implement nested lists.

        \subsubsection{Theme 6: Plotting and Graphs}
            The student must be able to create 2D plots i.e. the student must
            be familiar with different presentations of data, presenting
            multiple graphs on the same figure, displaying grids, labelling of
            the axis, naming of figures, using legends, and scaling axis
            systems. The student must take note of arrays which are an object
            type of the \texttt{numpy} module and understand their associated
            operators (\texttt{+, -, *, **}). The student must be familiar
            with creating 3D figures. The student has to be familiar with
            creating surface and mesh plots.

        \subsubsection{Theme 7: Reading and Writing Data}
            The student must be familiar with reading and writing to and from
            \texttt{CSV} files. The student must be able to store the data in
            a given format. The student must also understand how to access
            data, stored by Python, in LibreOffice and \textit{vice versa}.

        \subsubsection{Theme 8: High Level Programming}
            The student must be able to navigate Python's documentation as well
            as online documentation and be able to find, read and understand
            the documentation of the required functions in order to solve
            specific problems. The student should therefore be able to
            independently increase his/her knowledge of the Python programming
            language.

            The student must then be able use these additional modules and
            functions in Python in order to solve a specific problem.
