    \subsection{Teaching Assistants}
        The contact details and consulting hours for the teaching assistants
        will be added to {\it ClickUP} as soon as the teaching assistants have
        been allocated.

    \subsection{Consulting Hours}
        Consultation hours of the lecturers and teaching assistants will be
        announced at the start of the semester. These hours will also be
        displayed on their office doors and on {\it ClickUP}. These hours
        indicate when the lecturers and teaching assistants are on campus and
        available for consultation. Students are requested to please make an
        appointment so as to ensure that the lecturers and teaching assistants
        are in their offices.

        Students are welcome to make special arrangements to see the lecturers
        at times outside of their consulting hours if necessary. It is
        important not to wait until just before a test or exam to clarify any
        problems. There will be no extraordinary consulting hours during test
        and exam times.

        Students are also welcome to make use of the discussion board on {\it
        ClickUP}. This will allow lecturers, teaching assistants, and fellow
        students to answer any queries regarding programming concepts, exercise
        problems, etc. during their free time.
